## Alexa CAPS

During the Pandemic many students have seen an uptick of anxiety and mental health problems. <br>Most universities offer mental health services to students, but many students don't know how to get into contact with these mental health professionals. <br>Rather than waiting for a crisis to occur before learning what number to call, I created an Alexa Skill that allows students to quickly get their universities mental health services phone number to help them be able to talk to a professional as quickly as possible. 

## Tech Used
I of course used Alexa, but I also used AWS Lambdas, Python, and Selenium to create this Alexa Skill.
